  /// [address] or [components] Required parameters - The street address that you want to geocode, in the format used by the national postal
  /// service of the country concerned. Additional address elements such as business names and unit, suite or floor numbers
  /// should be avoided.
  /// The components filter is also accepted as an optional parameter if an address is provided.
  /// Each element in the components filter consists of a component:value pair, and fully restricts the results from the geocoder.
  ///
  /// [bounds] Optional parameters - The bounding box of the viewport within which to bias geocode results more prominently.
  /// This parameter will only influence, not fully restrict, results from the geocoder.
  ///
  /// [language] Optional parameters - The language in which to return results.
  ///   - See the list of supported languages. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.
  ///   - If language is not supplied, the geocoder attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the Accept-Language
  ///     header, or the native language of the domain from which the request is sent.
  ///   - The geocoder does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal,
  ///     it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing
  ///     the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in
  ///     the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
  ///   - If a name is not available in the preferred language, the geocoder uses the closest match.
  ///   - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which
  ///     they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for
  ///     street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and tér are synonyms for
  ///     street and square respectively in Hungarian.
  ///
  /// [region] Optional parameters - The region code, specified as a ccTLD ("top-level domain") two-character value. This parameter
  /// will only influence, not fully restrict, results from the geocoder.
